= Misc RPM SPEC files

== paraview-legacy

In general ParaView 5.x (where x >= 3) is build with OpenGL2 back-end, which
does not work on old hardware (like my T410). So, the only purpose of the
package is to have ParaView 5.x with legacy OpenGL back-end.

Basically it is adaptation of SPEC file from Fedora's repository.
